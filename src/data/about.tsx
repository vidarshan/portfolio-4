export const about = ` I'm passionate about designing and building efficient digital
    products that elevate everyday workflows and user experiences.
                With nearly four years of hands-on experience as a software
                engineer, I specialize in delivering high-quality, reliable
                solutions that align seamlessly with stakeholder goals. <br />
                <br /> My core competencies span the full stackâ€”from crafting
                responsive, intuitive interfaces through frontend web
                development with React, to building robust backends via
                Node.js-powered API development. I also bring experience in
                cross-platform app development with React Native, enabling
                consistent experiences across iOS and Android, as well as native
                iOS development for tailored, high-performance mobile solutions.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm deeply curious about emerging technologies, particularly in
                AI and cloud infrastructure, and actively explore how they can
                be integrated to enhance scalability, personalization, and
                automation in modern applications. I stay ahead of industry
                trends to craft solutions that are not only functional, but
                forward-thinking and impactful. Whether refining existing
                systems or architecting new ones, I thrive on turning complex
                challenges into intuitive, scalable, and intelligent software.`;
